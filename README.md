Below is a brief overview of each project...

Project 1: LC-4000 Datapath
- Designed a datapath in Circuit Sim to implement a custom instruction set architecture
- Implemented a microcontroller unit for the processor
- Loaded the microcontroller unit with a microcode control program I wrote as per the custom ISA

Project 2: 
- Hooked up the interrupt and data lines to a new timer device
- Modified the LC-4000 datapath and microcontroller to support interrupt operations
- Wrote an interrupt handler to operate two new devices in Assembly
- Added functionality for device-addressed input as well

Project 3:
- Implemented key parts of a virtual memory system simulator in C, including the page fault handler and frame eviction algorithms
- Used GDB to debug

Project 4:
- Implemented the process scheduler and 3 different scheduling algorithms for a multiprocessor OS simulator using a popular threading library for Linux called pthreads
- Ensured thread-safe synchronization by protecting all data structures used with mutex locks

CS3251_PA2:
- Created a multi-client chatroom with persistent TCP connections, password authentication, text parsing to develop a custom
application layer protocol, & broadcasting using python socket programming
